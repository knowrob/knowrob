/*
	- TODO: make swrl configurable for mongolog
	- idea: 3 ways: 1. standalone prolog reasoner 2. datasource of prolog 3. datasource of mongolog
		- PrologReasoner: __init__.pl could be added as DataSource,
		  but then all c++ code would be bypassed (loading swrl format)
		  -> maybe file loader can be registered from prolog code, but would need
		     to interact with reasoner state, e.g. via static map of reasoner instances.
		- MongologReasoner: __init__.pl can also be loaded, database interface must be exchanged though.
		- can the PrologReasoner have sub-reasoner? hmm might not be a good idea
	- TODO: register format handler through prolog declarations
 		- I guess must be a multifile predicate that PrologReasoner
		  checks after package initialization. but more complex, there should
		  be format handlers available only to a subset of reasoner.
		  well could maybe be that init declares facts thatare loaded into  plugin modules
		  and cpp looks up these facts only from the plugin module
	- TODO: exchange swrl database interface via a flag. currently a reasoner_setting swrl:backend
	        is thought for that. but it seems a bit unelegant to check this flag always.
	        - options could be included as argument internally to make it less ugly.
	        - it could be ignored and the check done each and every time
	        - the database predicates could be loaded into the plugin module, and reasoner could use these instead of an explicit backend

  Some useful tasks:

    install: deploys jar's to MavenLocal() (i.e. ~/.m2/repository)
    publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenRepository : deploys jar's to devel/share/maven
    installApp : assembles java apps in the _subproject_/build directories.

  Note that these are dependent on the type of project (e.g. installApp is only valid for
  java binary subprojects, while publishMavenJav... is only added once a subproject is included.
  If you're using catkin_make, this is not important, since it will use the task list specified
  in CMakeLists.txt
